=== Topics ===

Topics with Emcaster are just strings. They can be any length and are encoded in UTF-8 for transport. The topic could be the entire content of the message (e.g. stock-quote-aapl-85.05). Clients can selectively receive messages based upon regular expressions.

Unlike some topic based libraries, Emcaster topics can be created dynamically at runtime. If needed, every message can be sent under a different topic.

{{{
publisher = ... create a publisher
int count = 0;
....
publisher.publish("topic-"+(count++), "msg".getBytes());
}}}

=== Topic Filtering ===

Topics are filtered using basic regular expressions. Specifically, The [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.text.regularexpressions.regex.aspx Regex]  class is used to compile and execute the expression.

=== Defining Namespaces ===
Since topics are regular expressions, take care to avoid characters commonly used in regular expressions such as asterisks and periods.
