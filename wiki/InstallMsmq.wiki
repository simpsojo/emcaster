Message Queuing 3.0 must be installed and running on computers that will be sending and receiving messages using Emcaster. MSMQ installs PGM as a dependency. Emcaster does not use MSMQ, only PGM.  MSMQ conveniently installs PGM.

== Steps ==

  # On the Start menu, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.
  # Double-click Add/Remove Programs, and then click Add/Remove Windows Components.
  # Select Messaging Queuing from the list.

You might need the Windows Install Disc to add the component.
